# FFXCutsceneRemover
Cutscene skipping program for the Windows version of Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.
If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, please open an issue on GitHub or contact us in the cutscene-remover channel of the [FFX Speedrun Discord](https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG).

### Important

* This mod is designed and tested to be used solely for Any% Speedruns. Using this mod for other speedrun categories or normal playthroughs is not currently supported and you will likely encounter game-breaking bugs.

* Using the speedup booster (F1) with this mod is not supported, and is highly likely to cause crashes when the cutscene skips occur.

### Usage:

1. Download the latest release (x64 or x86) from the [releases page here](https://github.com/erickt420/FFXCutsceneRemover/releases).

2. Extract and launch FFXCutsceneRemove.exe.

3. Launch Final Fantasy X.

The order in which you launch the mod and the game does not matter.
You do not need to start a new game in order to gain the effects of the mod, however, if you start from a save file you may find that it takes a while before the cutscenes start skipping.

### Arguments:
You can use multiple arguments by separating them with a space.
- enable debug:  
`FFXCutsceneRemover.exe true`
- change the amount of milliseconds the program sleeps between polling iterations:  
`FFXCutsceneRemover.exe 50`
